# Data folder policy

- Full raw & processed data are **not** stored in this repo.
- During development, place data in Google Drive under `MyDrive/MLBA_Project/data/`.
  - `data/raw/`      → raw inputs (NAV, TRI, macro)
  - `data/processed/`→ merged tables, features, predictions
- This repo ships only a tiny **sample** under `data/sample/` for smoke tests.
