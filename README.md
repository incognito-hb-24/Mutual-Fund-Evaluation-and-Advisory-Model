# Mutual-Fund-Evaluation-and-Advisory-Model
---

##  Overview <br>
The **Mutual Fund Advisory & Evaluation Model (MLBA)** is a comprehensive end-to-end machine learning framework designed to evaluate, forecast, and simulate mutual fund performance using real-world data and economic indicators. <br>

It combines data engineering, predictive modeling, diagnostic validation, and backtesting — providing an analytical foundation for fund recommendation and investment decision-making. <br>

The model is built in phases to ensure transparency, interpretability, and full reproducibility. Each stage transforms data into deeper intelligence — starting from raw NAVs and ending with actionable portfolio-level insights. <br>

##  Walkthrough of the Project <br>

### Phase 1 — Data Ingestion & Master Creation <br>
- All raw NAVs, TRI, and macroeconomic indicators (such as VIX, USD/INR, G-sec yield, Gold, Brent, etc.) are cleaned, aligned, and merged chronologically. <br>
- The final **`clean_master_union.csv`** acts as the unified time-series base for the model. <br>

### Phase 2 — Feature Engineering <br>
- Generates fund-level and market-level rolling metrics such as returns, volatility, Sharpe ratio, beta, and drawdown. <br>
- Macro variables are lagged and normalized to avoid lookahead bias. <br>
- Sparse columns and incomplete rows are removed, resulting in **`clean_with_features.csv`** — the primary feature dataset. <br>

### Phase 3 — Model Training & Ensemble Building <br>
- A binary classifier predicts whether each fund will outperform the TRI benchmark over the next 63 days. <br>
- Models used include Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, and a weighted Ensemble. <br>
- Outputs include PR-AUC scores, confusion matrices, and per-fold evaluation summaries. <br>

### Phase 4 — Diagnostics & Validation <br>
- Analyzes precision-recall curves, cost optimization, ablation tests, and feature impact. <br>
- Each model’s thresholds are tuned to align with practical business trade-offs between precision and recall. <br>
- This phase also measures sensitivity to hyperparameters and generates interpretability plots for key drivers of fund alpha. <br>

### Phase 5 — Portfolio Simulation & Backtesting <br>
- Transforms model predictions into real fund selection decisions under a realistic no-lookahead scenario. <br>
- Simulates rebalancing weekly (W-FRI) and calculates equity curves, Sharpe ratios, hit rates, and turnover. <br>
- The model demonstrates consistent positive alpha with controlled drawdowns and diversified fund exposure. <br>

### Results Interpretation <br>
- Strong PR-AUC (~0.72) indicates high discriminative performance. <br>
- Sharpe ratios above 1.5 with a 65% hit rate show robust profitability. <br>
- Turnover around 0.44 ensures sustainable rebalancing frequency. <br>
- Ablation studies confirm macroeconomic indicators significantly enhance accuracy. <br>
